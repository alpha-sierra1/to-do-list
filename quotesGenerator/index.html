        Life just doesn't care about our aspirations, or sadness. It's often
        random, and it's often stupid and it's often completely unexpected, and
        the closures and the epiphanies and revelations we end up receiving from
        life, begrudgingly, rarely turn out to be the ones we thought. Khaled
        Hosseini

        The truth is that killing innocent people is always wrong - and no
        argument or excuse, no matter how deeply believed, can ever make it
        right. No religion on earth condones the killing of innocent people; no
        faith tradition tolerates the random killing of our brothers and sisters
        on this earth.

        It is necessary to fall in love... if only to provide an alibi for all
        the random despair you are going to feel anyway. Albert Camus

        O! many a shaft, at random sent, Finds mark the archer little meant! And
        many a word, at random spoken, May soothe or wound a heart that's
        broken! Walter Scott

        Everything happening around me is very random. I am enjoying the phase,
        as the journey is far more enjoyable than the destination. Sushant Singh

        I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen. Everything
        is completely accidental and random. Sometimes bad things happen to very
        good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people. But at least
        if you try to do good things, then you're spending your time doing
        something worthwhile. Helen Mirren

        Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe
        in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you.
        Princess Diana

        Together we can change the world, just one random act of kindness at a
        time. Ron Hall
